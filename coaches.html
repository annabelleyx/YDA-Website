            <h1>The YDA's Coaches</h1>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Throughout much of the history of the Yale Debate Association, the organization was led by a coach who was a full time member of the faculty. Most notably, the YDA was coached by the late Rollin Osterweis, 
                who successfully led the team for decades. Dr. Osterweis gained notoriety during the 2004 elections, when he was credited with teaching both John Kerry and George W. Bush the finer points of debate and public 
                speaking. This picture shows both Dr. Osterweis (back row, first from left) and Mr. Kerry (back row, third from left), along with the rest of the team. 
                <br><br>
                Since the early 1980s however, the organization has been entirely student run. A student elected board is charged with managing the team's tryout process, finances, tournament selections, and all other important decisions. 
                However, the team still has regularly obtained the help and advice of formerly successful debaters that are still part of the Yale community at the Law or Graduate school to help guide the team. Although these coaches do not 
                always play a direct role in the day to day operations of the team, they have played an important function in helping to develop skills and run tournaments.
            </p>
