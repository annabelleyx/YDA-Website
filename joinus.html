                        <h2>Our Selection Process</h2>
                        <p>Each fall, the YDA selects about 20 first-years and sophomores to form a new class of Yale debaters. In most years, 100 to 150 
                            students apply for these spots. As such, the YDA board conducts a rigorous tryout process. But don't worry if you've never debated before! 
                            We've turned more than a few complete beginners into national champions.
                            
                            Join us at our demonstration debates on Sunday, 8/29 and Monday, 8/30, from 10:00pm-11:30pm, location TBA! After each debate, team members 
                            will be around to answer any questions you may have about the team or the audition process. During Camp Yale, we'll be canvassing all around campus, 
                            so look around for us on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday! 
                            
                            2021 tryouts will be held from Tuesday, August 31st, to Sunday, September 6th, and then callbacks will be until Wednesday the 9th. To directly sign up 
                            for a tryout, submit here.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>The YDA is the only intercollegiate debate organization at Yale University. We compete around the world, host five tournaments at Yale, and are a 
                                partner organization of the Urban Debate League in New Haven.

                            <h5>How can I become a member of the YDA?</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Every fall, shortly before classes begin, the YDA hosts a short tryout process. Prospective members are given five minutes to argue in favor of a prompt, 
                                then five minutes to prepare a five-minute speech opposing a prompt. After delivering that speech in front of the team's Executive Board, the Board conducts 
                                a brief interview with each prospective member.

                            <h5>How many members does the YDA accept annually?</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>This number varies from year to year, depending on the strength of the tryouts and the openings on the team. We try to keep the team's total membership between 
                                40 and 50, so we accept roughly 15-20 students a year.

                            <h5>I missed tryouts my freshman year. Can I still join the YDA?</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Yes. The YDA does accept a limited number of sophomores (and potentially juniors). However, when accepting upperclassmen, we look for individuals who can integrate 
                                seamlessly into their class - that is, individuals who can compete as if they had not missed a year of collegiate debate experience.
                            </p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Absolutely. Many of our most successful debaters have no debate experience prior to joining the team. In fact, several debaters, from national champions to worlds 
                                finalists, had little to no debate experience until starting at Yale.

                                1.  The Yale IV, an international competition conducted in British Parliamentary, the style of the World Universities Debating Championships.
                                <br>
                                2.  Yale APDA, an American Parliamentary Debate Association tournament.
                                <br>
                                3.  The Yale Invitational, a national-circuit high school competition.
                                <br>
                                4.  The Osterweis Tournament, a free-entry tournament for Connecticut high school students.
                                <br>
                                5.  The Adams Cup, an intramural debate championship at Yale.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>There are plenty of opportunities for non-team-members to participate in YDA-sponsored debate at Yale. 
                                Options include judging at the Yale High School Tournament and the Osterweis Tournament, competing in the Adams Cup, 
                                or coaching New Haven high school students through Urban Debate League.

                            <p>The YDA competes exclusively in parliamentary debate, which emphasizes extemporaneous creativity over exhaustive research.
    
                                We are a member of the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA), a league including the rest of the Ivy League, most universities on the East Coast, 
                                Stanford, and the University of Chicago, among others. As a result, we regularly compete in the American Parliamentary format. The YDA also travels internationally 
                                to Canada, the UK, and elsewhere (including Mexico, South Africa, the Netherlands, and Thailand) to prepare for and compete in the World Universities Debating Championships, 
                                conducted in British Parliamentary.
